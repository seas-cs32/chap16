It’s not at all hard to get started debugging with print-statements,
and that’s why they’re our first tool for finding and fixing errors.
But as your scripts get longer and more complex, you’ll long for better
tools. And several exist for finding design and subtle coding errors,
which we’ll cover in the next two chapters. In Chapter 15, we’ll build
a runtime debugging tool, which gives you the functionality of debugging
print-statements (and more) without you having to edit and rerun your
script. In Chapter 16, we’ll learn that it is possible, using static
analysis tools, to find some of your script’s coding errors without
editing or running it.
